Here is brief detail about the  libraries used in this project:

CTYPES-And ctypes is a foreign function library for Python. It provides C compatible data types, and allows calling functions in DLLs or shared libraries. It can be used to wrap these libraries in pure Python. 
PSUTIL-The psutil (process and system utilities) is a cross-platform library for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors) in Python. It is useful mainly for system monitoring, profiling and limiting process resources and management of running processes. 
WEBBROWSER-The webbrowser  provides a high-level interface to allow displaying Web-based documents to users. Under most circumstances, simply calling the open() function will open the webbrowser.  
SUBPROCESS-The subprocess module allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes. 
WINSHELL-The winshell module is a light wrapper around the Windows shell functionality. It includes convenience functions for accessing special folders, for using the shell’s file copy, rename & delete functionality, and a certain amount of support for structured storage. 
 WIKIQUOTE-Wikiquote is a free online compendium of sourced quotations from notable people. Pyjokes is the library with one line jokes for programmers.
